This is a clone of the Asteroid Radar app found [here](https://github.com/Hossam-Sayed/asteroid-radar), entirely built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 design.

## Description

Introducing Asteroid Radar 2.0, a reimagined Android application built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Material 3. This modernized version retains the original’s commitment to precision asteroid monitoring, now enhanced by the latest advancements in UI development.

Asteroid Radar 2.0 is a clone of the acclaimed original, meticulously re-engineered using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It continues to leverage the robust Retrofit library for seamless communication with NASA’s API, delivering real-time asteroid data. The app’s architecture has been refined, maintaining the Room database at its core for persistent data storage, including the captivating ‘Image of the Day’ feature.

Adopting the modern MVVM architecture and repository pattern, Asteroid Radar 2.0 boasts an optimized single-activity approach. It utilizes Kotlin coroutines for efficient asynchronous operations, while state-of-the-art LiveData and MutableStateFlow ensure a reactive user experience by dynamically updating UI components.

The transition to Jetpack Compose has streamlined the interaction between the app’s data and visual elements, with a high-performance LazyColumn replacing the traditional RecyclerView. Background tasks, including database updates, are adeptly managed by WorkManager, ensuring the application remains current even while users are offline.

Asteroid Radar 2.0 has undergone rigorous review and adheres to the same high standards that led the original to pass Google’s assessment in Udacity’s Advanced Android Kotlin Nanodegree.

Key Enhancements:

- Rebuilt with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for a modern UI/UX
- Real-time asteroid tracking with updated NASA API integration
- Persistent data storage with an improved Room database structure
- Advanced MVVM with repository pattern for robust app architecture
- Single-activity design for enhanced app performance and multiple composables
- Asynchronous processing with Kotlin coroutines for seamless operations
- Streamlined UI interactions with Jetpack Compose
- Efficient background task scheduling with WorkManager

Asteroid Radar 2.0 is not merely an application; it’s a portal to the cosmos, offering an immersive experience while continuing to set new benchmarks in Android app development with its innovative features and performance. Discover the universe at your fingertips with Asteroid Radar 2.0—the next evolution in celestial exploration.
